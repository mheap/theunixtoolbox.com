<p>A lot of new CLI tools depend on a `golang` install.</p>

<h3>Installing on Ubuntu</h3>

Assuming that you're running as the vagrant user
{% highlight bash %}
mkdir /home/vagrant/gocode
echo "export PATH=/home/vagrant/gocode/bin:$PATH >> /home/vagrant/.bashrc"
source /home/vagrant/.bashrc
sudo apt-get install golang
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Ensuring it works</h3>

{% highlight bash %}
go --help
{% endhighlight %}
