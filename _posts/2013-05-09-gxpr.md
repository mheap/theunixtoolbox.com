Today's utility is a little bash script that searches Google and returns the value
that Google Calculator supplies. If Google Calculator can't work out the answer, it
delegates and gives you a link to Wolfram Alpha.

<hr />

## Example

Whilst the script is called `gxpr`, I've simply called it `g` as it's easier to type.

{% highlight bash %}
# It can do simple maths
vagrant:~$ g 1+1
2

# And it can do conversions
vagrant:~$ g 3984588 bytes in mb
3.79999924 megabytes

# It can even answer questions
vagrant:~$ g speed of light in mph
670616629 mph

# But sometimes it doesn't know, and asks Wolfram
# When this happens, control/option-click the link to open it
vagrant:~$ g 1368035948 unixtime
"google doesn't know 1368035948 unixtime"
⌘ click: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1368035948%20unixtime
{% endhighlight %}


## The script

If you want to use `g`, you'll need to create a file called "g", copy the following script into it and make sure that the file you created is somewhere in your $PATH and that you run `chmod a+x` on it to make it executable.

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh
CURL='curl -s --header User-Agent:gxpr/1.0'
GOOGLE="http://www.google.com/ig/calculator"
WOLFRAM="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/"
EXPR=$(echo "$@" | perl -MURI::Escape -ne 'chomp;print uri_escape($_)')

res=$(
  $CURL "$GOOGLE?q=$EXPR" |
  perl -ne '/rhs: "?([^\[\],":]+)/ and print $1' |
  perl -pe 's/[^\x00-\x7F]//g'
)

# if we don't have a result, try wolfram alpha
test -z "$res" && {
    echo "google doesn't know" "$@" 1>&2
    echo "⌘ click: \033[4m$WOLFRAM?i=$EXPR\033[0m"
    exit 1
}

echo "$res"
{% endhighlight %}
