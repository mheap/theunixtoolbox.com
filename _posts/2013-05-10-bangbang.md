Two quick terminal input manipulation commands today. The first is bangbang (`!!`). `!!` is a shortcut that means "substitute this with the last command run". It's most commonly used when you forget to `sudo` a command.

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant@precise64:~$ apt-get install tmux
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - 
open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/),
are you root?

vagrant@precise64:~$ sudo !!
sudo apt-get install tmux
[sudo] password for vagrant:

{% endhighlight %}

<hr />

If you want to make sure the command is right before executing it, you can add `:p` to the end to say "print this" instead of "execute this".

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant@precise64:~$ sudo !!:p
sudo apt-get install tmux
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can hit the up arrow and enter to run the command.

If you want a bit more versatility, you can use `^caret^substitution`. This means "find this first string in the last command, replace it with the second one and run the command again".

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant@precise64:~$ sudo apt-get install tumx
