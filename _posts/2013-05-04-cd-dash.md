A short one today. In keeping with the moving around theme from yesterday, I want to take a look at `cd -`. `cd -` means "take me back to the last directory I was in". 

So, starting in `~/theunixtoolbox.com`, and running `cd /etc` would take us to `/etc`. Running `cd -` would 
take us back to `~/theunixtoolbox.com` and running `cd -` again would take us back to `/etc`.

<hr />

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant@precise64:~/theunixtoolbox.com$ cd /etc

vagrant@precise64:/etc$ cd -
/home/vagrant/theunixtoolbox.com

vagrant@precise64:~/theunixtoolbox.com$ cd -
/etc

vagrant@precise64:/etc$ â€‹

{% endhighlight %}
