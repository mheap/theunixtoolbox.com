CDPATH is an environment variable that changes how the `cd` command works. Normally when you try and cd
into a directory, it will only try and change to the path specified from the current directory. If you spend a
lot of time working in specific folders, it might be useful to assume that your search path for `cd` starts from one of those folders.

For example, I spend a lot of time working in `/var/www`. Instead of typing cd /var/www/example.com all the time, I want to be able to
just type `cd example.com` and have it know what I mean. Here's how to set that up:

{% highlight bash %}
export CDPATH=.:~:/var/www
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you can just type `cd example.com` and it will look for `./example.com` then `/var/www/example.com`, stopping whenever it finds a match
or runs out of search locations.

You can have as many base search paths as you like. Here's one that includes `/etc` as a search path too.

{% highlight bash %}
export CDPATH=.:~:/var/www:/etc

vagrant@precise64:~$ pwd
/home/vagrant

vagrant@precise64:~$ cd example.com
/var/www/example.com

vagrant@precise64:/var/www/example.com$ cd mysql
/etc/mysql

vagrant@precise64:/etc/mysql$ cd Downloads
/home/vagrant/Downloads
{% endhighlight %}
