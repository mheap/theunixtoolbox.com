title: Substitution with sed
date: 2013-06-10

This week, I've been using `sed` quite a lot. `sed` is short for **s**tream **ed**itor, and is designed to work with large amounts of streaming text.

The most common use case that most people have for `sed` is text substitution. As it's a stream editor, by default it looks at one line of input at a time.

So for example, given the following input:

{% highlight bash %}
the number one is number one
then comes number two
and number three comes third
{% endhighlight %}

<hr />

Running the following command would replace "number" with "NUMBER".

{% highlight bash %}
sed 's/number/NUMBER/'
{% endhighlight %}

Just like perl, substitution only affects the first match - you need to be explicit to make it replace all occurrences. In this case, that's by adding the `g` flag.

{% highlight bash %}
sed 's/number/NUMBER/g'
{% endhighlight %}

So, if we run:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "the number one is number one\nthen comes number two\nand number three comes third" | sed 's/number/NUMBER/g'
{% endhighlight %}

We should see:

{% highlight bash %}
the NUMBER one is NUMBER one
then comes NUMBER two
and NUMBER three comes third
{% endhighlight %}

Applying this to an existing set of text can be done by feeding filenames into `sed` and using the `-i` flag, saying "change in place".

So for example, to replace all occurrences of the word "Dog" with the word "Cat":

{% highlight bash %}
find . -type f | xargs sed -i 's/Dog/Cat/g'
{% endhighlight %}
