A nice quick tip to get the ball rolling again.

If you've ever deleted a branch on a remote system only to have it recreated when you `git push`, this one's for you. It will make git only push the current branch by default; other branches are not pushed to the server. This helps to ensure for example that deleted branches do not get re-pushed accidentally.

{% highlight bash %}
git config --global push.default current`
{% endhighlight %}

If you do want to push all branches you've got locally, you can use the `--all` flag like so:

{% highlight bash %}
git push --all
{% endhighlight %}
