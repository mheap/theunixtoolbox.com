  <h3>A little about me</h3>
  <p>The Unix Toolbox is a side project by <a href="http://twitter.com/mheap">Michael Heap</a>.</p>
  <p>Inspired by <a href="http://tilvim.com/">tilvim</a>, I realised that I spend a *lot* of time customising my command line experience, and that others might benefit from the things that I learn too.</p>
